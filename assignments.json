    "description": "In this assignment, I created a KMeans Clustering Visualization where the user can input the number of clusters and choose how they want to initialize the centers. They can all also step through the algorithm or skip to the end where the data converges. They also are given the ability to generate random datasets and reset any algorithm.

    "description": "In this assignment, I explored the impact of changing parameters on linear regression. The goal was to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results, especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking these settings, I was able to observe how randomness can influence the slope and intercept in a regression model.
